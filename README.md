![POWERBI-CAPSTONE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c85932d7-ce43-42cd-a5ad-b6a8c7b528cd)

OVERVIEW

This project analyzes **hospital patient records** to evaluate **operational efficiency, clinical activity, and financial performance** using interactive **Power BI dashboards**.

By examining **encounter classes, claim costs, payer coverage, and patient demographics**, the analysis helps stakeholders understand **where costs arise, how services are utilized**, and how patient characteristics influence care delivery and financial outcomes.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Hospitals generate large volumes of data across **patients, encounters, procedures, and finances**, but this data often exists in **separate systems**.

Without a unified view, decision-makers struggle to:

- Monitor operational efficiency
- Identify major cost drivers
- Understand patient demand patterns
- Balance quality care with financial sustainability

This lack of integration can lead to **poor resource allocation, hidden cost risks, and missed opportunities for preventive care**.

OBJECTIVES

- Analyze **hospital operational and financial performance**
- Identify **high-demand and high-cost encounter classes**
- Evaluate **payer coverage and financial risk exposure**
- Understand **patient demographics and geographic distribution**
- Deliver **data-driven insights** to improve efficiency and care quality

  BUSINESS QUESTIONS
  
- Which **encounter classes** (ambulatory, outpatient, inpatient, emergency) are most common?
- Which encounter class has the **highest average claim cost**?
- Which **payers** cover the largest share of claim costs?
- What is the **age, gender, and ethnicity distribution** of patients?
- Which **cities** contribute the most patients?
- What are the **most common and most expensive procedures**?
- How do **age, gender, payer, and location filters** affect cost and utilization patterns?

KEY FINDINGS

OVERALL HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE

- **974 patients**, **27.9K encounters**, and **47.7K procedures**
- **Total claim cost:** $101.5M
- Patients average **29 encounters**, indicating very high utilization

ENCOUNTER CLASSES AND COSTS

- **Ambulatory (12.5K)** and **Outpatient (6.3K)** dominate encounter volume
- **Inpatient encounters** are the most expensive at **$7.8K per encounter**
- **Outpatient encounters** are the least expensive at **$2.2K per encounter**

PAYER COVERAGE

- **Uninsured patients** account for nearly **50% of total claim costs ($49M)**
- **Medicare** is the second-largest payer, covering **$25M**
This creates significant **financial risk exposure** for the hospital.
    

PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC

- Average patient age: **73 years**
- **64%** of patients are **Seniors (65–79) or Elderly (80+)**
- Gender distribution is nearly equal (**50.7% male, 49.3% female**)
- **Non-Hispanic patients** make up **80.4%** of the population
- **Boston** contributes over **half of all patients (541)**

CLINICAL ACTIVITY AND PROCEDURE

- Most common procedures:
    - Health & social care assessments (4.6K)
    - Hospice care regimes (4.1K)
    - Depression screenings (3.6K)
    - Substance use assessments (2.9K)
- Most expensive procedures:
    - ICU admission ($210K)
    - Coronary artery bypass graft ($50K)
    - Lumpectomy of breast ($30K)
- **Female patients account for 95% of procedure volume**, highlighting strong demand for women’s health services.

FILTER INSIGHT

- **Age filters:** Seniors and elderly patients increase inpatient and emergency care costs
- **Gender filters:** Females drive outpatient and preventive services; males drive urgent and emergency care
- **Payer filters:** Medicare aligns with high-cost inpatient care; Commercial payers show lower-cost outpatient services
- **City filters:** Boston dominates volume, while smaller cities show narrower service mixes

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. STRENGTHEN FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

- Encourage **uninsured patients** to enroll in coverage programs
- Monitor **inpatient and ICU procedures**, which are major cost drivers

2. EXPAND GERIATRIC AND CHRONIC CARE PROGRAMS

- Invest in services for **elderly patients**, who form the majority of the patient base
- Emphasize **preventive and community-based care** to reduce hospitalizations

3.SCALE PREVENTIVE AND WOMEN’S HEALTH SERVICES

- Continue expanding **screening and wellness programs**
- Strengthen women’s health services due to high utilization

4. IMPROVE GEOGRAPHIC SERVICE BALANCE

- Reduce over-reliance on **Boston** by expanding outreach to smaller cities
- Tailor services based on local demographics and payer mix

CONCLUSION

This analysis reveals that the hospital serves a **predominantly elderly, high-utilization population**, resulting in:

- High inpatient and emergency demand
- Significant financial exposure from **uninsured patients**
- Cost pressure from rare but **high-cost procedures**

At the same time, the hospital shows strong performance in **preventive care, hospice services, and women’s health**.

With better payer engagement, geriatric care management, and data-driven operational planning, the hospital can improve **patient outcomes**, **financial sustainability**, and **long-term efficiency**.
